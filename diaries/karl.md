17/2 - 2021
Started researching on audio compression.

18/2 - 2021
Continued research of audio encoding. Also looked up the data types Vector and ByteString

19/2 - 2021
Met up with Alesandro at campus to work on the project. Decided to start coding the Bytestring compression first.

21/2 - 2021
Implemented the bytestring compression and pushed it to github. Continue research on how to best compress audio in "real time".

23/2 - 2021
Group meeting with supervisor. Group decided that we will postpone encoding the audio and see if sending PCM with lowered sample rate,
converted to bytestring and compressed, will suffice to be sent over network.
Also wrote testing for AudioCompression.hs

25/2 - 2021
Meeting. Time to add everything together and test it.
Looked into command line parsing and wrote a "skeleton" but it ended up not being used when we switched from GetOpt to argparser.

1/3 - 2021
Meeting with supervisor. Started writing on the report. Wrote about compression in sectioin 1 and 2 and some of the external libraries.

2/3 -2021
Writing. Restructured some parts of the report and started writing discussion. Added how to runt test cases to README.md.

3/3 -2021
Wrote some of the example usage and discussion parts, particulary the shortcomings of compression. Some more restructuring and changes to introduction

4/3 - 2021
Met up at campus to finnish up the report. Made a lot of changes. Rewrote parts of introduction, exemple usage, discussion. Proof reading and some last minute changes.
