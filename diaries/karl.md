Started researching on audio compression.

18/2 - 2021
Continued research of audio encoding. Also looked up the data types Vector and ByteString

19/2 - 2021
Met up with Alesandro at campus to work on the project. Decided to start coding the Bytestring compression first.

21/2 - 2021
Implemented the bytestring compression and pushed it to github. Continue research on how to best compress audio in "real time".

23/2 - 2021
Group meeting with supervisor. Group decided that we will postpone encoding the audio and see if sending PCM with lowered sample rate,
converted to bytestring and compressed, will suffice to be sent over network.
Also wrote testing for AudioCompression.hs

25/2 - 2021
Meeting. Time to add everything together and test it.
Looked into command line parsing.
